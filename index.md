1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

    I believe that the most interesting topic we covered this quarter was learning about transfromers and LLM work theorically. It was interesting to understand how these LLM models work, their limitations, and the current research being done to improve them.
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

    One potential investigation was to make our LLM models to be multimodel and not just take in text as input, but have the capability to take other forms of inputs like images and audio. 
3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

    One potential change I would think would have been better is that we began work with deep learning codes a bit earlier in the quarter. We spent the first 5 weeks of the quarter learning about the theory, but having small coding assignments would have been helpful to understand the theory better and have some experience with creating LLM earlier.
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

    I think that it will be interesting to use
